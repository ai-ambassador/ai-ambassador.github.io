**Graduate school, especially a PhD, is very different from college.** By the end of a successful PhD, you will have added to humanity's collective pool of knowledge. Due to the creative nature of graduate school, it can be more fulfilling (and also more challenging) than undergrad. At the very least, it requires a different set of skills than are required for doing well in courses.

**Research is a social endeavour!** By the end of grad schoool, you'll be part of a community of people with similar interests, and you'll form lifelong relationships with your advisor and colleagues.

**Most STEM PhD programs are funded.** This means that you'll be paid for doing research. How much depends on the program, but AI is one of the hotter fields at the moment. Schools in America tend to pay $30k-60k/year depending on whether you do a corporate research internship during the summer or academic year. Some European schools pay more, around $90k/year; those are usually 3 years and require a master's. Income can also be supplemented through various 3rd party scholarships and fellowships, many of which are reserved for students from underrepresented groups. 

The best way to get an idea of what grad school is like is to simply talk to someone in grad school. However, **we've also collected some great resources from people who did really well in grad school:**
