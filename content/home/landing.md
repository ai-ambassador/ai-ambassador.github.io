The AI Ambassador program is a series of "reverse visit days" for students to connect with active AI researchers in 1-1 or small group settings. The idea is that grad students and faculty travel to other institutions for a half- or full-day, give a short research talk, and then meet with whoever might be interested in AI research. Our goal is to broaden the AI research community to those not yet well represented in top AI conferences (e.g. CVPR, AAAI, NeurIPS, etc.). 

The program is run by a consortium of university research departments active in AI research. The ambassadors themselves are a mix of faculty and grad students who have collectively won numerous awards, including career faculty awards, best paper awards, Fulbright scholarships, and more. To learn more about the program, keep reading!

- If you represent a group at a college/university and would like to connect and arrange a reverse visit day, please [contact us](#contact)!
- If you are a propective student interested in applying to grad school in AI, check out our [resources page](#apply).
- If you are a current researcher who would like to be an ambassador, please [contact us](#contact).
- If you represent a university research department and would like to get involved, please [contact us](#contact).
- We are not currently accepting corporate sponsorships.
